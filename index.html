                    <p>Long-form blogs and articles are my specialty as a freelance health writer. <br>
                        They are my favorite way to educate and inspire readers while offering a <br>
                        high ROI to my clients. Long-form blogs offer high online visibility through <br>
                        better search engine ranking, allow link building, and improve social media sharing. <br>
                        They allow you to create reliable website authority and become a true go-to expert in your field. <br>
                        They provide endless opportunities to sell your products and services and sneak in affiliate links <br>
                        without being a sleazy salesman.</p>

                    <h6 class="mt-3">EBOOKS + OPT-INs</h6>
                    <p>
                        Ebooks are one of my favorite marketing strategies. <br>
                         They serve as great opt-ins by offering great value for your<br>
                          audience and helping you grow your email list. Ebooks (like this one) <br>
                           serve as a valuable “free gift” that you can offer with your product. <br>
                            This ebook, and several others I’ve written for Organifi, are “free gifts” <br>
                             they offer with their superfood packages offering another reason to choose <br>
                              a package over buying single product. Ebooks are also great and simple products <br>
                               that you can sell on your website. As a freelance holistic health writer, ebooks are my (gf) bread and butter.

                    <p>
                        Let’s be real: Google is where most people find you. People trust Google <br>
                        and they search it every day. You need SEO-optimized quality blogs that <br>
                        are not just stuffed with keywords but offer valuable information and are <br>
                        strategically written. As a holistic health writer, I keep SEO and Google in <br>
                        mind. My blogs regularly rank high on Google. This means traffic, leads, and <br>
                        sales without ads! This blog is ranked #1 on google offering great value for a <br>
                        new start-up business. Other examples of my work that appear on the first page 
                        of google include this, this, and this.

                    <p>
                        The internet is full of health and wellness information. Unfortunately, many blogs are not backed by science or any evidence. As your freelance health writer, I know that you want to present your client with the most up-to-date information. All my health content is thoroughly researched and always supported by the newest scientific studies, credible references, reliable scholarly resources, and statistics. With the help of well-researched health content and copy, you can quickly become the top credible expert in your field. Hire me as your health writer and get science-backed content.
